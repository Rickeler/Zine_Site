               <p>Coming up with a topic can be the most difficult part of making a zine. I find getting all my ideas out on paper helps solidify what I want to say. After coming up with your topic, jot down some ideas about what you want to say about your topic and what you want to accomplish with your zine.</p>
               <h3>Examples of Genres</h3>
               
               <p><b>Prezine</b> - personal zines, these zines are about your lived experiences. It can help legitimise your experiences and share your perspective with others.<br>

               <p>Now that you have your ideas, it’s time to get them on a page. I recommend creating a dummy (sketch) version of your zine, even If you’re creating a zine digitally. Consider how the text and images in your zine will interact, and the hierarchy of information. What is an order that makes the most sense for your content? What is the most important information for a reader to gain? 
                  <br><br>
                  If your zine is going to have type, consider how that will look. On a page there can be several levels of type; title, headings, body, captions, etc. If you’re typing out your zine I recommend choosing no more than 3 typefaces. Using handwritten or collaged type can add an interesting effect as well. To make your zine easy to read if you include a lot of text, make the lines short (9-12 words per line) and aligned to the left. You can experiment with adding columns of text and how that can wrap around images.</p>        
               <h3>Important tips</h3> 
               <ul class="howtolist">
                  <li>Remember margins! Leave space for your bindings and for the scanner to read your master copy, or you'll end up with your content cut off. Leave at least a ¼” of blank space around the edges of your pages.</li>
                  <li>Is your zine accessible? As in, easy to read, not too busy, easy to reproduce. Will the images hold up after photocopying?</li>
               </ul>  
               <h3>Sample layouts</h3>
               <p><b>Folio/half fold</b><br><i>You’ll need: 8.5x11 paper, stapler or another binding method.</i><br>
                  Common and simple format, binding is the hardest step. This gives you alot of page space and is convient if you're creating your zine digitally.</p>
               <div class=howtonumber><ol>
                  <li>Fold and order your pages width-wise. You'll need a quarter of the pages (including cover) you want in the final zine.</li>
                  <li>staple, stitching or bind with a rubber band. If you’re stapling either use a long arm stapler or staple on top of cardboard then plush down prongs with your finger.</li>
               </ol></div>
                  <br>
               <p><b>8 page mini-zine</b><br><i>You’ll need: a sheet of 8.5x11 paper, scissors or exacto knife</i><br>This is an easy method without need for binding. I've seen zinesters put fold out posters on the reverse of this format.</p>
                  <div class=howtonumber><ol>
                     <li>Fold the piece of paper length-wise, unfold. Then fold the paper width-wise. You should have sections now.</li>
                     <li>With the paper oriented landscape, fold the left and right sides to the middle. Unfold and you'll have your eight pages.</li>
                     <li>Fold it in half width-wise again, take your scissors or knife and cut the length of a page on the middle fold. </li>
                     <li>Fold in half length-wise. Open up the centre and push the inside edge of the pages together, it should look like a plus sign. Flatten with the front and back cover on the outside.</li>
                  </ol></div>
                  <br>
               <p><b>Accordion fold mini-zine</b> <br><i>You’ll need: a sheet of 8.5x11 paper, scissors or exacto knife</i><br>This method allows for alot of pages in a small zine and intresting vertical pages.</p>
               <div class=howtonumber><ol>
                  <li>Orient the paper portrait, fold in half length-wise, fold in half again. Unfold, this should create 4 columns.</li>
                  <li>Repeat but folding width-wise to create a grid.</li>
                  <li>Using your knife or scissors cut along the horizontal creases leaving the last page in intact. Cut the top and bottom creases from the left and the middle one from the right.</li>
                  <li>Fold along the creases to create your zine. Pay attention to the fact that each row flips for placing your content.</li>
               </ol></div>
                  <br>
               <p><b>Victorian love note fold</b><br><i>You’ll need: a square sheet of paper, scissors or exacto knife, a ruler, I recommend using a bone folder</i><br>Inspired by Victorian cards this is an un-tradtional method for zine. It is more difficult to fold but has lots of interaction for the reader. It's better for zines with not alot of text.</p>
               <div class=howtonumber><ol>
                  <li>Fold and unfold the corners of your paper to create an 'x' shaped crease.</li>
                  <li>Measure and crease the thirds. Turn your paper and crease the thirds in the opposite direction.</li>
                  <li>Fold all of the corners into the bottom left corner of the middle square.</li>
                  <li>You should be able to twist the corners along the crease lines to create a pinwheel. Crease down all the folds again.</li>
                  <li>Fold the arms in to the centre, starting with the bottom on and going counter clockwise. Tuck the last one into the first arm you folded to secure.</li>
               </ol></div>
